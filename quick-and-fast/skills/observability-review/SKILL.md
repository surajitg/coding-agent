## Logging
- Structured logging (key-value)
- Correlation ID propagation across layers
- Exceptions are always logged with context

## Monitoring
- Key business metrics exposed
- Health checks implemented

## Tracing
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- External dependency visibility

## Diagnostics
- Logs actionable (who, what, why)
- Avoid log noise
